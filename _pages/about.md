Hi, I'm Joon. I'm a a rising fourth year student at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu), pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm a member of [RAISE group](https://nandofioretto.github.io/group/) at UVA, led by [Prof. Ferdinando Fioretto](https://nandofioretto.github.io). For Summer 2025, I'm working as a research intern at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/)'s School of Computer Science, advised by [Prof. Steven Wu](https://zstevenwu.com).

My research focuses on algorithmic fairness and differential privacy, particularly how privacy noise impacts decision-making tasks. I'm also interested in reconstruction attacks and their practical implications for data privacy. *Fun fact:* my [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 3.

**I’m applying to Ph.D. programs in the upcoming cycle (December 2025).**
