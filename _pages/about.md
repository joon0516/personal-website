Hi, I'm Joon. I'm a third year student at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu), pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm a member of [RAISE group](https://nandofioretto.github.io/group/) at UVA, led by [Prof. Ferdinando Fioretto](https://nandofioretto.github.io).

My research focuses on algorithmic fairness and differential privacy, particularly how privacy noise impacts decision-making tasks. I'm also interested in reconstruction attacks and their practical implications for data privacy.

**I'm applying to Ph.D. programs in Computer Science and Operations Research in the next cycle. Feel free to reach out—I’d appreciate any connections!**
