Hi, I'm Joon. I'm a fourth year student at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu), pursuing a double major in computer science and mathematics. I'm a member of [RAISE group](https://nandofioretto.github.io/group/) at UVA, led by [Prof. Ferdinando Fioretto](https://nandofioretto.github.io). I spent summer 2025 as a research intern at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/)'s School of Computer Science, advised by [Prof. Steven Wu](https://zstevenwu.com), and continue to collaborate with him.

My research interests lie in algorithmic fairness, differential privacy, optimization, and uncertainty quantification. Broadly, I’m interested in the societal impact of AI, particularly in high-stakes decision-making settings. *Fun fact:* my [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is [3](https://www.csauthors.net/distance/joonhyuk-ko/paul-erdos).

**I’m applying to Ph.D. programs in the upcoming cycle!**
