  <p>I like theory. I started collecting physical copies of math books in 2024 and have been self-studying many topics as a hobby, and sometimes for classes. (Iâ€™m planning to add a picture of my bookshelf here soon ðŸ“š)</p>

  <p>Hereâ€™s a niche fact about me: I live in Whyburn House at the University of Virginia. This dorm is named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Whyburn">Gordon Whyburn</a>, a UVA math professor known for his work in topology. One of his PhD students at UVA, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_L._Kelley">John L. Kelley</a>, later chaired the math department at UC Berkeley and is well-known for his classic <em>General Topology</em>. I own a copy of the last book he wrote, <em>Measure and Integral</em>.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-8">
      <p>Another fun fact: I once had dinner with <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/people/stephen-abbott">Stephen Abbott</a>, author of <em>Understanding Analysis</em>, one of the most widely used undergraduate real analysis textbooks. He got his PhD in math at UVA and is now a professor at Middlebury College. In 2025, he attended UVA's math majors' annual dinner, and I was lucky to sit right next to him. Here's a picture of my signed copy of <em>Understanding Analysis</em>.</p>

      <p>One last fun fact: I took my real analysis course at UVA with <a href="https://uva.theopenscholar.com/nick-kuhn/">Nick Kuhn</a>, the son of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_W._Kuhn">Harold Kuhn</a>, one of the Ks in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions">KKT conditions</a>. It was his final semester teaching at UVA before retiring.</p>
