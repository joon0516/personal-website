  title = {Fairness Issues and Mitigations in (Differentially Private) Socio-Demographic Data Processes},
  author={Joonhyuk Ko and Juba Ziani and Saswat Das and Matt Williams and Ferdinando Fioretto},
  abstract={Statistical agencies rely on sampling techniques to collect socio-demographic data crucial for policy-making and resource allocation. This paper shows that surveys of important societal relevance introduce sampling errors that unevenly impact group-level estimates, thereby compromising fairness in downstream decisions. To address these issues, this paper introduces an optimization approach modeled on real-world survey design processes, ensuring sampling costs are optimized while maintaining error margins within prescribed tolerances. Additionally, privacy-preserving methods used to determine sampling rates can further impact these fairness issues. The paper explores the impact of differential privacy on the statistics informing the sampling process, revealing a surprising effect: not only the expected negative effect from the addition of noise for differential privacy is negligible, but also this privacy noise can in fact reduce unfairness as it positively biases smaller counts. These findings are validated over an extensive analysis using datasets commonly applied in census statistics.},

  title = {Optimal Allocation of Privacy Budget on Hierarchical Data Release},
  author = {Joonhyuk Ko and Juba Ziani and Ferdinando Fioretto},
  abstract = {Releasing useful information from datasets with hierarchical structures while preserving individual privacy presents a significant challenge. Standard privacy-preserving mechanisms, and in particular Differential Privacy, often require careful allocation of a finite privacy budget across different levels and components of the hierarchy. Sub-optimal allocation can lead to either excessive noise, rendering the data useless, or to insufficient protections for sensitive information. This paper addresses the critical problem of optimal privacy budget allocation for hierarchical data release. It formulates this challenge as a constrained optimization problem, aiming to maximize data utility subject to a total privacy budget while considering the inherent trade-offs between data granularity and privacy loss. The proposed approach is supported by theoretical analysis and validated through comprehensive experiments on real hierarchical datasets. These experiments demonstrate that optimal privacy budget allocation significantly enhances the utility of the released data and improves the performance of downstream tasks.},
